Intelligent Customer Support Agent with LangGraph
Overview
An intelligent customer support agent using LangGraph, a powerful tool for building complex language model workflows. The agent is designed to categorize customer queries, analyze sentiment, and provide appropriate responses or escalate issues when necessary.

Goal
In today's fast-paced business environment, efficient and accurate customer support is crucial. Automating the initial stages of customer interaction can significantly reduce response times and improve overall customer satisfaction. This project aims to showcase how advanced language models and graph-based workflows can be combined to create a sophisticated support system that can handle a variety of customer inquiries.

Key Components
State Management: Using TypedDict to define and manage the state of each customer interaction.
Query Categorization: Classifying customer queries into Technical, Billing, or General categories.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of customer queries.
Response Generation: Creating appropriate responses based on the query category and sentiment.
Escalation Mechanism: Automatically escalating queries with negative sentiment to human agents.
Workflow Graph: Utilizing LangGraph to create a flexible and extensible workflow.
Method Details
Initialization: Set up an environment and imported necessary libraries.
State Definition: Created a structure to hold query information, category, sentiment, and response.
Node Functions: Implemented separate functions for categorization, sentiment analysis, and response generation.
Graph Construction: Used StateGraph to define the workflow, adding nodes and edges to represent the support process.
Conditional Routing: Implement logic to route queries based on their category and sentiment.
Workflow Compilation: Compile the graph into an executable application.
Execution: Process customer queries through the workflow and retrieve results.
